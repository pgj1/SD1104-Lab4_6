LAB 4.6: Array To Do List
Lesson Time: 60 Minutes

In this lab, you’ll be working with arrays and for loops to get practice on working with collections.

Scenario:
You work for a company that runs a To-Do list web app. The website allows users to type in tasks 
for each day of the week so that they remember to do them. You’ve been asked to use C# to create 
a small to-do list planner. As usual, someone else will handle how the code will work on the web, 
you’ve been asked to write the initial test version of the logic.

Requirements:
The do-to list planner with cycle through each day of the week, pausing to let the user type in a task. 
The planner will save each task the user types in, and then display all of the days and tasks together. 
See the screenshot below for an example of the screen output.

Tips:
* You will keep each day in an array of “days”.
* You’ll save the tasks in an array of “tasks”.
* You need to setup for each loops to loop through the days and tasks.
